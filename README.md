# ProjectEXGB
This project is a side project developed by a team of server members. Our objective is to allow for the bot to provide functionality and features of a general usage bot in a single bot called "EXGB". This bot will either be written in JavaScript or Python. 

The project is currently in development and is still in the planning phase. We aim for the following features to be developed in the coming months, including (but not limited to);
- Uncensored open-source LLM that supports NLP for general Q/A session
- Play music by using YTDL to download and convert any YouTube videos into .mp3 format, capable of playing music.
- Fetch X (Twitter), YouTube, or Facebook posts and re-post it to the server

As of now, the bot is planned to be only allows for whitelisted users to use the bot.
